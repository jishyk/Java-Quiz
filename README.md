# JavaScript Quiz

## Javascript, CSS, and HTML
For the Javascript code, I made a Script.js, Logic.js, Highscores.html, and Index.html. 
The index.html loads the deployed applicaton, with the corrisponding javascript allowing the quiz to respond, and react. When answering the questions you will be graded on the time left to finish which is 60 seconds. 
If you get the question Correct or Wrong, it will tell you on the bottom. 
If you get a Question Wrong, you will be decuted 5seconds from the clock. 
Once the test is finished, you will have the option to save your Score. 
Once the score is saved it will go to the HighScores.html which will then save it to the localstorage. 
Your able to ether reset the highscores list, or go back to the start of the quiz and take it again. 
The Highscores.html is connected with the Logic.js to allow this highscores and save to be implemented. 
With the Style.css sheet I was able to implement colors, and borders along with certian shapes of the questions, and if you hover over a answer or the start, and save button it will glow.
